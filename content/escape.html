            Sometimes you no longer recognize yourself.
            You want to overcome it, but it overcomes you. You want to set limits, but it compels you to keep going. You want to elude it, but it comes with you. You want to employ it, but you are its tool; you want to think about it, but your thoughts obey it.
            Finally the fear of the inescapable seizes you, for it comes after you slowly and invincibly.
            There is no escape.</div>
