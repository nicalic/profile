        <div id="typewriter">Shut your eyes so that you do not see the manifold, the outwardly plural, the tearing away and the tempting.
            There is only one way and that is your way; there is only one salvation and that is your salvation.
            Why are you looking around for help? Do you believe that help will come from outside? What is to come will be created in you and from you.
            Hence look into yourself. Do not compare, do not measure. No other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and tempt you.
            You must fulfill the way that is in you.</div>
